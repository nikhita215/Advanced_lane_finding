# Advanced_lane_finding

**This repository contains the following information:**

• Report consisting of the steps to identify lane lines on a road from an image or a video ("Advanced Lane Finding.pdf")

• Jupyter notebook with the corresponding python code ("Advanced Lane Finding.ipnby")

• Sample output from processing a video ("project_video_output.mp4")

**The aim of this project is:**

•	Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images

•	Apply a distortion correction to raw images

•	Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view")

•	Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image

•	Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary

•	Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center

•	Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image

•	Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position
