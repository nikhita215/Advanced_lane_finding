# Advanced_lane_finding

This repository contains the following information:

• Report consisting of the steps to identify lane lines on a road from an image or a video ("Report_finding_lane_lines.pdf")

• Jupyter notebook with the corresponding python code ("P1.ipnby")

• Sample output from processing 2 videos ("solidWhiteRight.mp4", "solidYellowLeft.mp4")

The aim of this project is:

•	Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.

•	Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
•	Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
•	Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
•	Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
•	Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
•	Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
•	Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
